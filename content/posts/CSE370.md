How swift time can fly when at times you have 3-5 projects going on at once. The Spring '22 Semester was one to remember, that was for sure. But looking back on it months later, I am content with all that I managed to do and learn in the process. It may have been a lot at times, but it was beautifully so. The end result of all of the projects is something I am thrilled about, and have been wanting to share through a blog post for quite some time now!
Prepare yourself for explanations and a grand amount of accompanying images. There is much I wish to discuss!
