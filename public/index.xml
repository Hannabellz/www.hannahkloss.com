      <description>How swift time can fly when at times you have 3-5 projects going on at once. The Spring &amp;lsquo;22 Semester was one to remember, that was for sure. But looking back on it months later, I am content with all that I managed to do and learn in the process. It may have been a lot at times, but it was beautifully so. The end result of all of the projects is something I am thrilled about, and have been wanting to share through a blog post for quite some time now!</description>

      <description>What can be done in 24 hours, or less? Where else would you find a junior in college during the Fall Back dates than in her room, wrapping up a solo game project after fourteen hours straight of looking at a computer screen? It was sometime after 2AM when I called it good so I could rest, but would I do it again? Absolutely. This was my first Hackathon experience, and although I opted to do it remotely, it was still incredible.</description>

      <description>Hello! After being directed to using Hugo for personal website development, I took to the reigns (and online documentation) to get right into creating what would likely become my portfolio. I am interested in &amp;ldquo;complex&amp;rdquo; game design, where my definition is as follows. In an ideal world, there would be sufficient time to make multiple games where the player choice matters. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t just slightly alter dialogue or anything easily missed, or miniscule.</description>
