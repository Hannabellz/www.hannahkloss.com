      <description>###What can be done in 24 hours, or less? Where else would you find a junior in college during the Fall Back dates than in her room, wrapping up a solo game project after fourteen hours straight of looking at a computer screen? It was sometime after 2AM when I called it good so I could rest, but would I do it again? Absolutely.
